Place to note milestones

1/29/24
Did all the set up to commit from CLI. Used homebrew, edited the shell config, installed and updated git, installed github credential manager, did my first git init, commit, message, push, also did the global user.name and user.email config. Took a while. I can see the moon from my desk in the morning light blue sky.
